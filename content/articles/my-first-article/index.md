title: "Java Snake Game"
description: "This was one of the first personal programs I made. It's a simple snake game but when I first programmed it, it took me roughly 2 weeks to figure out how to make everything work. The game uses Java and creates a GUI to play the game."

## Description
This was one of the first personal projects I ever made. This was back when I had first starting programming. I still didn't really understand the concepts of Java and was struggling quite a bit in my classes.

Eventually, I decided to start practicing coding on my own time. I chose Snake because I would play it often on my phone and figured it would be an easy way to practice.

I used three different classes for this program. GamePanel.java is where the majority of the code is. It was all the game mechanics. GameFrame.java was in charge of opening the GUI. SnakeGame.java is where the main is and all it does is start the game.

Overall, this program helped me learn about GUIs and how to use them. As well as helping me learn how to use several different methods at once.
